    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagne, or the singular lasagna, is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of thin flat pasta alternating with 
        fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce) and other vegetables, cheese (which may include ricotta 
        and parmesan), and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil.
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
